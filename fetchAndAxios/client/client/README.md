# fetch API를 axios라이브러리를 사용하여 바꾸는 것은 정말 간단하다. npm install axios로 라이브러리 받아준다. import axios from 'axios' .  fetch가 들어간 자리를 axios로 바꾸어 주기(만약 코드가 지저분해 진다면 async, await문법을 사용해 주면됨)

이렇게 데이터를 가져오고 post하는 코드를 하나의 custom hook으로 뺄 수 있습니다. 이렇게 하면 나만의 훅이 되지만 이런 유용한 custom hooks들을 한데 모아놓은 라이브러리가 있는데 이것이 react-query입니다. react-query를 사용하면 더 쉽게 데이터를 가지고 올수 있습니다. 
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
